=head1 NAME

Object::Adhoc - make objects without the hassle of defining a class first

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Object::Adhoc;
 
 my $object = object { name => 'Alice' };
 
 if ($object->has_name) {
   print $object->name, "\n";
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object::Adhoc is designed to be an alternative to returning hashrefs
from functions and methods. It's similar to L<Object::Anon> but doesn't
do anything special with references or overloading.

=head2 Functions

=over

=item C<< object(\%data, \@keys) >>

Returns a blessed object built from the given arrayref.

For each key in the list of keys, a getter (C<name> in the SYNOPSIS) and
predicate (C<has_name> in the SYNOPSIS) method are created.

Objects are read-only.

Note that Object::Adhoc does not make a clone of C<< %data >> before
blessing it; it is blessed directly.

=item C<< object(\%data) >>

If C<< @keys >> is not supplied, Object::Adhoc will do this:

  @keys = keys(%data);

If there are some keys that will not always be present in your data,
passing Object::Adhoc a full list of every possible key is strongly
recommended!

=item C<< object(\%data, %opts) >>

The following options are supported:

=over

=item C<recurse>

Number of levels to recurse. By default, 0.

=item C<keys>

C<< object(\%data, \@keys) >> is a shortcut for C<< object(\%data, keys => \@keys) >>.

=back

=item C<< make_class(\@keys, %opts) >>

Just makes the class, but doesn't bless a hashref into it. Returns a string
which is the name of the class. If called repeatedly with the same keys,
will return the same class name.

By default, the class won't have a C<new> method; if you need to create
objects, you can just directly bless hashrefs into it.

Supported options.

=over

=item C<ctor>

Whether to create a constructor called C<new>. Defaults to false.

=back

It is possible to use this in an C<< @ISA >>, though that's not really
the intention of Object::Adhoc.

  package My::Class {
    use Object::Adhoc 'make_class';
    our @ISA = make_class [qw/ foo bar baz /], ctor => 1;
    sub foobar {
      my ($self) = (shift);
      $self->foo . $self->bar;
    }
  }
  
  say My::Class->new( foo => "Hello", bar => "World" )->foobar;

C<make_class> is not exported by default.

=back

=head2 Diagnostics

=head3 Ambiguous method '%s' is getter, not predicate

Given the following:

  my $object = object {
    name     => 'Alice',
    has_name => 1,
  };

Object::Adhoc doesn't know if you want the C<has_name> method to be a
getter for the "has_name" attribute, or a predicate for the "name" attribute.
The getter wins, but it will issue a warning.

=head3 Key '%s' would be bad method name, not generating methods

You've got a key with a name that cannot be called as a method.
For example:

  my $alice = object { 'given name' => 'Alice' };

Perl methods cannot contain spaces, so Object::Adhoc refuses to
create the method and gives you a warning. (Technically it is possible
to create and call methods containing spaces, but it's fiddly.)

This also happens for a few reserved method names like C<AUTOLOAD>,
C<DESTROY>, C<isa>, C<DOES>, C<can>, etc. These have particular meanings
in Perl that would conflict with them being used as a getter method.

=head3 Bad recurse option

The C<recurse> option must be a positive integer or zero.

=head3 Usage %s(self)

The methods defined by Object::Adhoc expect to be invoked with
a blessed object and no other parameters.

  my $alice = object { 'name' => 'Alice' };
  $alice->name(1234);   # error

This throws an exception rather than just printing a warning.

=head3 Usage %s(class, hashref)

The constructor created by the C<ctor> option was called with bad
parameters.

=head3 Bad key: %s

The constructor created by the C<ctor> option was called with an
unknown key.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs to
L<https://github.com/tobyink/p5-object-adhoc/issues>.

=head2 Comparison with Similar Modules

Object::Adhoc -
requires Exporter::Tiny and uses Class::XSAccessor if installed;
read-only accessors;
predicate methods;
optional recursion into nested hashrefs, arrayrefs, scalarrefs, and coderefs;
no overloading;
dies on unknown keys.

L<Object::Anon>
only core dependencies;
read-only accessors;
no predicate methods;
recuses into nested hashrefs and arrayrefs;
treats coderef values as methods and supports overloading;
dies on unknown keys.

L<Hash::Objectify> -
requires Class::XSAccessor;
read-write accessors;
no predicate methods;
no recursion;
no overloading;
dies on unknown keys (or returns undef in lax mode).

L<Hash::AsObject> -
only core dependencies;
read-write accessors (uses AUTOLOAD, potentially slow);
no predicate methods;
recurses into nested hashrefs;
no overloading;
returns undef for unknown keys.

Of the four, Object::Adhoc has the fastest accessors, and
Hash::Objectify has the fastest constructors. Object::Anon is
the slowest.

I'd recommend Object::Adhoc if you want read-only accessors,
or Hash::Objectify if you want read-write accessors. Use
Object::Anon only if you need the additional features it supports
for overloading, and custom methods to nested data structures.

=head2 Not Quite So Similar Modules

L<Object::Result> -
fairly different idea, but can be used for similar purposes.
Requires Perl 5.14, Keyword::Simple, PPI, and Method::Signatures.
